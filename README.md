## Motivation
Coordinating volunteers is a surprisingly hard and time-consuming task for small organizations and community groups. Most teams still rely on a mix of Google Sheets, Excel files, email threads, WhatsApp groups, or paper sign-up sheets. These methods are slow, error-prone, and provide no reliable way of knowing who has actually committed to volunteering. When event details or attendance of volunteers changes at the last minute, updating everyone becomes nearly impossible, and coordinators often spend hours manually trying to get responses.

Although existing commercial solutions exist, most small groups would not want to pay monthly fees, share their member data with third parties, or learn complex platforms. A simple self-hosted and free tool like VolunteerHub, would suffice.

That’s why we built VolunteerHub. We kept the scope minimal and focused on a clean REST API instead of building a full user interface. Our goal was to create a backend that is extremely easy to understand, test, deploy, and maintain, while still demonstrating every required cloud concept in depth. A simple, well-documented API can be used immediately with tools like Postman or curl, and an optional frontend can always be added later if desired. This decision allowed us to deliver a fully containerized, orchestrated, monitored, continuously deployed, and automatically backed-up system within the course timeline without sacrificing quality.

VolunteerHub directly solves the real coordination problem we experience every semester in student clubs, and it gave us the perfect way to master Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, persistent volumes, orchestration, monitoring, CI/CD, and backup strategies, as laid out in the learning objectives of ECE1779.
